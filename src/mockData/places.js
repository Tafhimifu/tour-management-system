At the end of the 8th century, King Shri Bhavadeva (Vobodev) made the “Salban Bihar” in this place. The digging started from 80th decades. Many archaeological elements were found here. Most of them are kept in the Mainamati Museum now.Previously it was known as Salban Rajar Bari. But after excavation ground plan of a Buddhist monastery measuring 550’x500′ with 115 monastic cells, it was exposed. Hence it is now popularly known as salbanvihara. The special attraction here is a dominant central shrine and its monumental gate way on the north. In its central shrine has revealed six building and rebuilding phases while in the monastery four. The terracotta in sealing indicates that the monastery was built by Sri Bhava Deva, the 4th ruler of the early deva dynasty during mid-8th century. Previously it was called Bhava Deva MahaVihara. The antiquities recovered during excavation are now displayed in the Maynamati Museum.Before 1200 years ago the King Bhava Deva, the fourth ruler of the Early-Deva dynasty built that place on 168 square meters of ground. It was the royal palace for the early Buddhist students. This site, previously called Shalban Rajar Bari, came out after archaeological excavation as a Buddhist monastery and hence termed as Salban vihara from the terracotta seals and copper plates discovered. Its original name is supposed to have been Bhava Deva Mahavihara after the 4th king of the early Deva dynasty which ruled this region from the mid-7th to mid-8th centuries AD. It was built in or on the outskirts of Devaparvata, the Samatata capital bordering the Lalambi forest.Another majestic new shrine stands tall shining light to all there is around, just beside the famous Shalban Bihar at Maynamati and its called New Shalban Buddha Bihar.The two storied temple is magnificently designed.

The Gumti River, identified with the ancient river Ksiroda, has now shifted a few hundred yards to the east, but once flowed along its eastern edge, partly washing its northern and southern foot as well. Its old silted up bed is still very clearly traceable.The site has been traditionally associated with the legendary Chandra Queen, Mainamati, mother of the last known Chandra King, Govinda Chandra, and is popularly regarded to have been the last seat of that dynasty.Limited excavations here for a season or two have uncovered part of a massive defense wall round different parts of the site, probably a citadel, and the corner of a substantial structure, probably a palace at the center of the site. Scholars widely regard it as the center of Devaparvata, the capital of Samatata.The Mainamati War Cemetery (alternatively: Comilla War Cemetery) is a war cemetery and a memorial in Comilla, Bangladesh, for Second World War graves from nearby areas during the Second World War. The cemetery contains 736 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War. It was established and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), to pay tribute to those who sacrificed their lives in World War II.Before the war Mainamati was a small settlement of a few dozen huts, but during the war (Second World War) a large military camp was established there. Several ordnance depots and a number of military hospitals, both British and Indian, were in the area, including Nos. 14 and 150 British General Hospitals; and the majority of the burials in Mainamati War Cemetery were from the various hospitals. Graves from isolated places in the surrounding country, and some from as far a field as Burma, were moved into the cemetery by the Army Graves Service and later on by the Commission; and it was found also necessary to transfer graves from small cemeteries at Dhaka, Faridpur, Paksay, Saidpur, Santahar and Sirajganj, where they could not be maintained.The cemetery was started by the Army and laid out by the garrison engineer. It is dominated by a small flat-topped hill crowned. Between the entrance and this hill lie the Christian graves, and on the far side of it are the Muslim graves. On a terrace about halfway up the hill, facing the entrance, stands the Cross of Sacrifice, and on the other side a shelter looks over the Muslim graves to a tree-framed view of the countryside beyond. There are now over 737 graves in this cemetery, that include the warriors of the then Pakistan/India, Japan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, USA, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries.","Road" : "It is very easy to access this place.

Excavations have revealed here the remains of a remarkable semi-cruciform shrine of medium size (28.2m east - west, 28m north - south), together with a number of subsidiary structures, including an octagonal stupa and another one on a square base. A boundary wall within the oblong stupa courtyard encloses all these. Its regular entrance is on the east, facing the monastery entrance. Deep diggings have revealed three main periods of building and repairs and rebuilding, the earliest corresponding to c.6th-7th centuries AD. Very few remains of the latest period (10th-11th century AD) survive now in this very heavily disturbed site.takhola Mura an archaeological site in mainamati. The site, like that of the kutila mura, is one of the most impressive ruins. It lies in three terraces on adjacent hillocks just opposite the rupban mura site across the Kotbari road, Comilla. It served for a long time as a quarry for ancient bricks, hence the name. Excavations have revealed here a grand stupa complex with an attached monastery, located 42m to its north. The cultural phases of the site are stated (or overstated) to be five; the earlier three being still buried underneath the later remains.Itakhola Mura,the Stupa Complex was originally built as a solid stupa in the traditional style on a 13.1m square basement. However, it has one peculiarity; a small sanctum (2.4m ' 2.1m) built in the centre of its eastern or front side.Here a damaged life-size stucco image of Aksobhya was found in situ. This part of the monument was fairly well preserved, but unfortunately, its jungle-covered top was sliced off by the military a few decades back to build a rest house here.Subsequently, the shrine was enlarged and elaborated by additions and alterations, especially by adding three long narrow chapels in the eastern side after blocking the old sanctum; thus giving the structure an oblong shape (41.4m × 24m).In this particular feature, it is strikingly similar to the Rupban Mura shrine. The side chapels were ultimately blocked up, leaving space for a few cubicles for installing cult images, as in other parts of the shrine. This establishment is surrounded by a 2.6m wide circumambulatory passage and is enclosed by a 1.2m thick boundary wall.","Road":"After reaching in Comilla, take autorickshaw or cng from Kotbari Highway to reach destination places which are near to Cantonment College in Sadar Upazila.","img1" : "https://i.imgur.com/aDb1zrB.jpg","img2" : "https://i.imgur.com/tBJi5Uc.jpg","img3" : "https://i.imgur.com/yexRW0T.jpg","img4" : "https://i.imgur.com/ut7jECf.jpg",

King of Tripura built it. It was named ‘Moharaja Radha Kishor Manikuo Bahadur’ during the 16th century. The gods Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were worshiped here. Initially, the statue of gods were at Tripura temple but later it was been shifted here. Wikipedia mentioned this as Saptratna Mandir, where as the travel book writer Mustafiz Mamun has introduced this as Sotero Rotno Mandir (সতের রত্নের মন্দির).

Department of Archaeology renovated outside portions of Ground and first floor. Terracotta of these two floors was ruined.There is a rumor about this ordinary looking spiritual place. Some believes there are two more floors underground, which is filled by sedimentation from Gumti River over the years. I feel this is a weak and bogus point.This 16th Century edifice is almost 60 feet tall. There is a tank to the West of Temple premises. That Tank could be as old as the temple.
